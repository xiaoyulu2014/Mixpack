This is a fast R Bayesian mixture model package. The speed up is achieved through calling from C code and parallelization using OpenMP. 


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
